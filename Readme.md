## Security Policy

### Final decision, choice of Arch Linux

While selecting a base image for our Docker containers, it is essential to consider not just security vulnerabilities but also performance, flexibility, and a lean environment. In this context, Arch Linux emerges as a superior choice over other Linux distributions. Despite its vulnerability, Arch offers a rolling release system, ensuring that users always have the latest software versions without the need for extensive upgrades. This results in a more streamlined, up-to-date, and performance-optimized system. Moreover, the Arch User Repository (AUR) provides a vast collection of user-submitted packages, further enhancing its adaptability and feature set. While the CVE-2023-29403 exploitability score for Arch might be a concern, it's worth noting that the Arch community is highly active, often leading to rapid patches and updates. This proactive approach, combined with the user-centric philosophy of Arch, ensures a balance between cutting-edge performance and security.


## Packages

Transparency exercise, command executed by user: `dev`

```bash
sudo pacman -S make gcc nano vim neovim wget curl ufw zip unzip git neofetch fontconfig zsh
```
